Based on the description you've provided, what you are developing can be considered a combination of a concept, an application, and a method. Let's break it down:

1. Concept: The concept refers to the overarching idea or approach behind your file management system. It involves centralizing and structuring your files and content in a unified manner, utilizing categories, subcategories, metadata, and tags to facilitate organization and retrieval.

2. Application: The application aspect refers to the software or tool you are developing to implement and execute the concept. In your case, it could be a Vue 3-based application that serves as the interface for managing files, notes, and content, providing functionalities like file organization, note-taking, metadata management, and search capabilities.

3. Method: The method represents the systematic approach or methodology you employ to manage and organize your files and content within the application. It includes defining categories, creating a hierarchical structure, assigning metadata, applying tags, and utilizing search and retrieval techniques.

Together, these three elements form a cohesive system that encompasses the concept, the application, and the method for managing and organizing your files and content in a centralized manner.

It's worth noting that the terminology may vary, and different individuals or organizations may refer to similar systems or approaches using different names. The most important aspect is that the concept, application, and method work together harmoniously to achieve your goal of efficient and structured file management.
